Title: **Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis & Visualization**

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicle (EV) data to understand adoption trends, vehicle types, and growth patterns.
It also includes interactive visualizations such as a moving bar chart to showcase EV adoption over time in an engaging way.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights for policy makers, researchers, and the public about the growth of electric mobility.

**Objectives:**
1. Explore EV adoption trends across different years.
2. Identify the most popular EV types and makes.
3. Analyze geographical distribution of EVs.
4. Visualize growth patterns using animated bar charts.
5. Provide clear and engaging insights for non-technical audiences.

**Key Features:**
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting columns.
2. Descriptive Analysis – Summary statistics, EV counts, and market trends.
3. Visual Insights:
- Bar charts and pie charts for EV distribution.
- Time-series plots showing growth trends.
- Animated bar chart race for EV adoption over years.
4. Interactive Output – Charts and plots for easy interpretation.

**Technologies Used:**
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Bar Chart Race library for animation
4. GitHub for version control

**Future Scope:**
1. Include real-time EV registration data from APIs.
2. Extend analysis with predictive modeling for adoption trends.
3. Integrate with dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
4. Develop a web-based interactive visualization for public access.
